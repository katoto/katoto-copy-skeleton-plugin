  - Open a suggestion issue first and add appropriate label to it.

  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature.

  - Then submit you PRs.

- If fixing a bug:

  - you are resolving a special issue, add`(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])`(#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g.`update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.

  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo or picture preferred.

- All PRs need to pass the **Travis Ci** before merged.
